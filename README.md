## keygen

This repo is used to generate keys for sharders, miners and blobbers.

## Step 1. 

Edit the number of miners, sharders and blobbers in nodes.sh if you need to generate keys for a network. 

## Step 2. 

Create an empty directory "outputs" to store key files generated by the container.

```bash
cd keygen
mkdir outputs
```

## Step 3. 

Run the container using docker-compose command depending on what is needed.


### Generate keys for a network

```bash
docker-compose -f nodes-docker-compose.yml up
```

The container will exit once the keys are generated. You can find the keys in 
*/outputs/ms-keys and /outputs/blob-keys dirs* . 

Nodes.yaml is stored in /outputs/config dir. 

### Generate a single pair of keys

```bash
docker-compose -f single-docker-compose.yaml up
```

The container will exit once the keys are generated. You can find the keys in
./outputs/single dir.
