## keygen

This repo is used to generate keys for sharders, miners and blobbers.

## Step 1. 

Edit the number of miners, sharders and blobbers in entrypoint.sh. 

## Step 2. 

Create an empty directory "outputs" to store key files generated by the container.

```bash
cd keygen
mkdir outputs
```

## Step 3. 

Run the container using docker-compose command.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The container will exit once the keys are generated. You can find the keys in */outputs/ms-keys and /outputs/blob-keys dirs * . Nodes.yaml is stored in /outputs/config dir.
